# landing-page
This project is all about layout with Flexbox. The goal was to replicate a landing page provided by The Odin Project. The intention was not to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy, but to demonstrate the ability to lay out a page using Flexbox.

The scope of this project did not include responsive design. This project is intended for viewing in a desktop browser and will not look right on a mobile device. Responsive design is coming!
